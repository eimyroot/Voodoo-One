# System Control Plane Boundary

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document status | Current contract boundary |
| Contract | `v-one-control-plane-decision/v2` |
| Source | `voodoo_product/control_plane.py` |
| Test inventory | `tests/system/test_control_plane_contract.py` |

## Purpose

The V-One system control plane decision contract is the single deterministic record that binds:

- operation semantics;
- skill orchestration;
- operation proof when a decision claims `VERIFIED`;
- explicit boundary;
- evidence references;
- acceptance gates.

Every decision and every decision element must also state its purpose and system benefit. A record
without a useful role is invalid even when its digest is otherwise deterministic.

The named control-plane usefulness gate is:

```text
decision_has_purpose_and_system_benefit
```

The named development usefulness gate is:

```text
change_has_purpose_and_system_benefit
```

Both gates are mandatory. The first applies to system decisions. The second applies to development
and implementation plans before a change is accepted as useful work.

## Current Boundary

This is a source-level contract only. It does not execute tools, trust plugins dynamically, approve
operations, mutate providers, dispatch runtime agents, or enable production effects.

## Decision Statuses

The only current decision statuses are:

- `VERIFIED`;
- `IMPLEMENTED`;
- `PROPOSED`;
- `BLOCKED`;
- `FAILED`;
- `UNKNOWN`.

`VERIFIED` requires an accepted operation proof and all acceptance gates set to `PASS`.
`IMPLEMENTED`, `PROPOSED`, and `UNKNOWN` require visible pending or blocked gates so the system does
not overclaim completion.

## Boundary Rule

Every control-plane decision must state:

- decision purpose;
- decision system benefit;
- allowed effects;
- prohibited effects;
- boundary purpose and system benefit;
- evidence references with exact operation id, source kind, source authority class, stable source identity, locator, digest, purpose and system benefit;
- acceptance gates bound to the exact evidence digest, source identity, and required source authority class, with purpose and system benefit;
- `decision_has_purpose_and_system_benefit` as an explicit acceptance gate;
- deterministic digest.

Missing boundary, evidence, exact operation/source binding, gates, purpose, or system benefit is invalid and fails closed. Evidence from another operation or source cannot satisfy a gate by digest alone.

## Development Rule

Every skill-orchestration plan for implementation work must state:

- change purpose;
- change system benefit;
- selected skills with purpose and authority;
- excluded operations;
- `change_has_purpose_and_system_benefit` as an explicit acceptance gate.

Missing development purpose, development system benefit, or the development usefulness gate is
invalid and fails closed.
