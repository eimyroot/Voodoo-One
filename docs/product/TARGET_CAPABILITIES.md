## Target capability template

Every target capability must define user problem, product value, authoritative owner, inputs/outputs,
trust boundary, failure behavior, evidence requirements, dependencies, acceptance criteria, rollback or
disable strategy, and current status.

## Verified/implemented foundation

The historical ADR-0007 pure deterministic v1 contracts remain historical foundation. The current
system has progressed beyond representation-only status in named scopes:

```text
AuthorizationSnapshot                = IMPLEMENTED / VERIFIED contracts + canonical authority path
ExecutionGrant/v2                     = IMPLEMENTED / VERIFIED
durable one-time Grant consumption    = IMPLEMENTED
Dispatch Outbox/Envelope/Inbox        = IMPLEMENTED
ExecutionEpoch/Lease/Fence            = IMPLEMENTED
ExecutionCapsule / RunnerBoundary     = IMPLEMENTED
bounded isolated READ Runner          = VERIFIED pilot scope
independent Verifier                  = VERIFIED bounded scope
VerificationResult/v1                 = VERIFIED bounded scope
canonical public READ API             = IMPLEMENTED / MERGED
restart-safe durable resume           = IMPLEMENTED / MERGED
```

The merged G8 provider runtime pack is still OFF by default, real product HTTP READ E2E is NOT VERIFIED, and
provider WRITE/release/deployment remain BLOCKED. Historical implementation does not silently rewrite
the exact design scope of older ADRs.

## T1 — Policy Decision Graph

**Status:** VERIFIED read-only projection foundation; organization-scoped authoritative policy/runtime
enforcement remains PROPOSED.

Accepted ADR-0006 provides `policy-decision-graph/v1` as a pure deterministic projection over supplied
facts. It does not itself become authorization authority. Target maturation still includes stored
organization-scoped policy decisions, drift invalidation, approval binding and explainable enforcement
without creating a second permission path.

## T2 — Authenticated execution-grant authority

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED for current `ExecutionGrant/v2` authority/persistence/one-time-consumption scope;
future signer/key-distribution and broader portable cryptographic attestation remain PROPOSED.

Current Grant authority binds the canonical snapshot, execution, capability, target, payload, policy,
approval/precondition evidence, runner class, revocation epoch, TTL and one-time semantics. Durable
consumption is control-plane state before Dispatch.

Future target work must preserve replay rejection, expiry/revocation handling, deterministic
verification and key rotation without weakening current exact-content authority.

## T3 — Isolated Runner Capsules

**Status:** VERIFIED bounded READ pilot primitives + IMPLEMENTED canonical READ terminal + merged G8
READ runtime pack; default product activation/live acceptance remain BLOCKED until the G8 gate passes.

Current verified/implemented controls include bounded Runner identity/boundary, current lease/fence,
capability/capsule binding, READ-only provider handling and isolated pilot runtime evidence. Target
productization still requires explicit default runtime composition, secrets/config operations,
repeatable canonical HTTP E2E, restart verification and release-grade operational controls.

## T4 — Structured execution and verification evidence

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED/VERIFIED in profile-specific current contracts; broader signed portable
provenance remains PROPOSED.

Current semantics are profile-specific:

```text
READ_ONLY_VERIFIED
→ VerificationResult/v1

BOUNDED_MUTATION_VERIFIED
→ ExecutionReceipt/v2
→ independent VerificationResult/v1
→ OperationProof/v2
→ OperationCell/v1
```

Raw credentials and uncontrolled provider responses must never become portable evidence.

## T5 — Expanded ProofGraph

**Status:** PROPOSED beyond the current checkpoint/proof foundations.

Target nodes may include source/tree, build, SBOM, vulnerability policy, artifact, publisher identity,
policy decision, approval, execution grant, Runner identity, execution, receipt, post-state observation,
checkpoint and external anchor.

Target verification includes remote byte verification, signature/trust-policy validation, registry
digest verification and transparency/object-lock anchoring.

## T6 — CyberCore read-only knowledge boundary

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED / CONTRACT-ONLY via PR #163; parser/trust/persistence/runtime integration remains BLOCKED.

The current `v-one-cybercore-intake/v1` contract binds CXP/Knowledge Block references and digests,
risk, target, bounded expected effect and verification-plan metadata. It performs no archive parsing,
persistence, API/network I/O, subprocess execution, approval, authorization or production effect.

Future intake productization still requires safe artifact parsing, publisher trust/signature handling,
idempotent persistence/audit and separately governed runtime integration. CyberCore remains intelligence
only and cannot issue grants, become Runner/Verifier or bypass V-One.

## T7 — AI Change Copilot

**Status:** PROPOSED.

The copilot may translate intent into drafts, summarize evidence/uncertainty, identify missing
preconditions, propose risk/tests/rollback/verification and explain policy or execution evidence.

It must not approve itself, issue grants, alter policy, activate production effects, suppress
uncertainty or execute external mutation directly.

## T8 — Enterprise identity and tenancy

**Status:** PROPOSED beyond current local identity/workspace-membership scope.

Target capabilities include released OIDC, step-up authentication, workspace-scoped role assignment,
tenant/platform-admin separation, key rotation and server-side revocation across supported identity
paths.

## T9 — Released PostgreSQL and HA operations

**Status:** PROPOSED.

Prerequisites include a released adapter, transactional migration locking, concurrency/isolation tests,
connection pooling, backup/restore/PITR, migration rehearsal, multi-node recovery, SLOs and operator
runbooks. Current PostgreSQL selection remains fail-closed.

## T10 — Signed multi-platform supply chain

**Status:** PROPOSED beyond current build/SBOM/checksum gates.

```text
immutable source
→ deterministic build
→ linux/amd64 + linux/arm64
→ SBOM
→ vulnerability report
→ provenance
→ signature
→ governed registry promotion
→ deployment verification
```

## T11 — Outcome learning loop

**Status:** PROPOSED.

```text
planned state
→ approved execution
→ observed post-state
→ drift/outcome comparison
→ knowledge update
```

V-One retains authorization/evidence ownership; intelligence layers retain knowledge/recommendation
ownership.

## T12 — G8 default READ provider runtime

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED PACK / PRODUCT ACTIVATION + LIVE ACCEPTANCE STILL BLOCKED.

The first default provider pack must be READ-only and reuse the existing canonical composition rather
than introduce a parallel execution framework. Required properties include:

- exact ProductService DB and DatabasePermissionAuthority;
- exact terminal-profile registry, envelope revision and current fence;
- explicit Runner and Verifier provider configuration;
- separate identities/credential decisions;
- no ambient credential fallback;
- exact `github.read-ref/v1` capability only;
- no CREATE_REF, DELETE_REF, rollback, generic execute or mutation transport;
- missing/ambiguous configuration fails closed.

## T13 — Real canonical HTTP READ E2E + restart continuity

**Status:** PROPOSED / BLOCKED pending explicit activation and live acceptance of the merged G8 pack.

Target proof chain:

```text
authenticated HTTP READ
→ current DB authority/membership
→ Snapshot
→ Grant/v2
→ one-time consumption
→ Outbox/Envelope/Inbox
→ ACTIVE Epoch/current Lease/Capsule
→ process interruption/restart before Runner completion
→ resume the same ACTIVE execution
→ no new prepare/grant/consume/outbox/envelope/inbox/epoch/lease
→ current-fence + authority-continuity validation
→ resumed isolated READ Runner
→ durable completion
→ independent Verifier with separate identity/credential decision
→ VerificationResult/v1
```

The current resume target is explicitly an `ACTIVE` execution. Resuming an already `COMPLETED` execution
or performing completed-execution reverification is outside T13 and requires a separate future contract.

Repeated successful and failure-injected evidence is required before provider WRITE may become merely
eligible under the governed READ-before-WRITE decision.

## T14 — Provider WRITE productization

**Status:** BLOCKED.

Current A09 CREATE_REF/rollback orchestration is pre-effect only. Provider mutation activation is not a
near-term default target: it remains blocked until the READ-before-WRITE evidence gate passes and then
still requires a separate effect-specific authority, credential, verification, rollback, security,
release and deployment decision.
