# VOODOO One Documentation

This directory is the entry point for product, architecture, governance, specification, operational
and release documentation. Live Git/GitHub/CI/runtime evidence outranks stale current-state wording;
normative authority remains governed separately by adopted records and repository policy.

| How must documentation stay truthful? | [`governance/DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md`](governance/DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md) |
| What is the READ-before-WRITE proposal? | [`adr/ADR-0019-read-e2e-before-write.md`](adr/ADR-0019-read-e2e-before-write.md) — PROPOSED |
| How will organization roles and approval profiles work? | [`adr/ADR-0003-organization-roles-and-configurable-approval-policy.md`](adr/ADR-0003-organization-roles-and-configurable-approval-policy.md) — still PROPOSED |
| What is the read-only Policy Decision Graph v1 boundary? | [`adr/ADR-0006-read-only-policy-decision-graph-v1.md`](adr/ADR-0006-read-only-policy-decision-graph-v1.md) |

| What is the owner-adopted isolated Runner design boundary? | [`adr/ADR-0008-isolated-runner-boundary-v1.md`](adr/ADR-0008-isolated-runner-boundary-v1.md) — historical design authority retained; later bounded pilot implementation/evidence is tracked separately |
| What threat model is bound to ADR-0008? | [`security/ISOLATED_RUNNER_THREAT_MODEL_V1.md`](security/ISOLATED_RUNNER_THREAT_MODEL_V1.md) — exact reviewed artifact remains immutable; later implementation does not rewrite it |

| How are local checkpoint candidates finalized? | [`adr/ADR-0004-repository-owned-checkpoint-finalization.md`](adr/ADR-0004-repository-owned-checkpoint-finalization.md) |

## Current truth hierarchy

For runtime/technical state use, in order:

```text
current repository content
→ live Git identity / GitHub settings evidence
→ executed tests / GitHub CI
→ runtime/pilot evidence
→ current-state docs
→ roadmap/vision intent
```

Normative document authority is separate and follows governance/adoption records.

## Current architecture distinction

```text
TRUST-PLANE COMPONENT CHAIN = IMPLEMENTED / deeply tested
CANONICAL FastAPI ProductComposition RUNTIME SEAM = IMPLEMENTED / MERGED
CANONICAL PUBLIC READ OPERATION API = IMPLEMENTED / MERGED
G7 DURABLE RESUME + RUNTIME WIRING = IMPLEMENTED / MERGED
G0 GITHUB GOVERNANCE = UNKNOWN current / historical VERIFIED evidence retained
DEFAULT PROVIDER RUNTIME PACK = DISABLED / FAIL-CLOSED
REAL CANONICAL HTTP READ E2E WITH DEFAULT PACK = NOT VERIFIED
READ_ONLY_VERIFIED TERMINAL = VerificationResult/v1
BOUNDED_MUTATION_VERIFIED TERMINAL = OperationCell/v1 after effect + independent verification
PROVIDER WRITE ACTIVATION = BLOCKED
PRODUCTION RELEASE / DEPLOYMENT = NOT PERFORMED
```

Do not collapse component presence, product composition, terminal-profile semantics, live verification,
release and deployment into one status.

## Structure

```text
docs/
├── README.md
├── adr/            Architecture decisions, historical decisions and proposals
├── architecture/   Current semantic/component/trust-boundary models
├── governance/     Documentation, authority and engineering governance
├── product/        Current capabilities, boundaries, readiness and runbooks
└── security/       Security threat-model artifacts
```

## Status rule

Capability documentation uses only:

```text
VERIFIED
IMPLEMENTED
PROPOSED
INFERRED
UNKNOWN
BLOCKED
```

A roadmap, ADR presence, merge, CI pass or evidence hash must not be promoted into a stronger runtime,
release or deployment claim without the required independent evidence.
